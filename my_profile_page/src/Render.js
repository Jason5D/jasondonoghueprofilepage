            With a strong background in supplying lighting technology to the
            construction industry, Ive witnessed the transformative power of
            technology first-hand, igniting my passion for being a change
            catalyst. My true passion lies in coding, which led me to enrol in
            the School of Codes intensive bootcamp. There, I honed my
            problem-solving skills and discovered programming has ability to
            drive innovation. Now, driven to make a tangible impact, I actively
            participate in tech meetups, eager to support newcomers in
            navigating the dynamic and ever-evolving field of technology.
